Blogify
=======

Reproducible Blogging with R Markdown

`blogify` is an R package (under development) that strives to make it simple to create and publish blogs by writing posts in `R Markdown`. The design of `blogify` will be similar to that of [`slidify`](http://github.com/ramnathv/slidify). It will draw upon the wonderful work done by static blogging frameworks like `octopress`, `jekyll`, `hyde` and `ruhoh`.
